# moviestape-parser
Parser of new movies from moviestape.net (This isn't an ad). Python + Selenium

To use it, you will need to have a geckodriver executable in the folder with main.py.
Also a list of recipients is needed to be in recipients.txt.

On the first run last_movie.txt will be created and it will store and automatically update last persed movie.
